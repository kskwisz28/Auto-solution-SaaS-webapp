        <p class="mb-5">AutoRanker was founded in 2019 and serves a bit over 200 mostly small and mid-sized businesses. Prior to AutoRanker, a member of our team spent six years implementing autocomplete-optimization projects for a small client base and this way, gained the necessary experience for AutoRanker.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">As our client, you benefit from almost 8 years of experience and hundreds of previously completed projects. We are your specialist when it comes to positioning your brand in the autocomplete function of search engines and we would love to work with you.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">We always conduct our work in a transparent and organic manner. We think long-term, plan painstakingly and support our clients in the creation, controlling and adjustments of their campaigns. Our own keyword database, a reporting portal and e-mail reports compliment our offerings.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">When implementing a campaign we hold ourselves to high standards - both the commercial success of our clients and the value-add to end users who interact with the suggests we manage. We only accept projects we personally believe in and which offer a sustained positive experience to end users.</p>
